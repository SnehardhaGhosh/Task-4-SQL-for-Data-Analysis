# Task-4-SQL-for-Data-Analysis

This project demonstrates the use of **SQL for data extraction and analysis** on an eCommerce dataset using **PostgreSQL**. The goal is to apply various SQL techniques such as filtering, grouping, joining tables, writing subqueries, creating views, and optimizing queries with indexes.

## ✅ Tasks Completed

### 🟦 A. Use SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY  
- **File**: `select_where_orderby.sql`, `select_join_groupby_orderby.sql`  
- Demonstrates filtering customers by city, sorting by signup date, and grouping order data by date.

### 🟦 B. Use JOINS (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT)  
- **Files**: `inner_join.sql`, `left_join.sql`, `right_join.csv`  
- Combines customer and order data using different types of joins.

### 🟦 C. Write Subqueries  
- **File**: `subquery.sql`  
- Shows how to use nested queries for advanced filtering or computed values.

### 🟦 D. Use Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG)  
- **Files**: `aggregate_function.csv`, `select_aggregate_groupby.csv`  
- Applies aggregate functions to analyze sales and product pricing.

### 🟦 E. Create Views for Analysis  
- **File**: `view.sql`  
- Creates reusable virtual tables for customer-order insights.

### 🟦 F. Optimize Queries with Indexes  
- **File**: `index_usecases.sql`  
- Implements indexing strategies to improve query performance.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **SQL dialect**: PostgreSQL
- **Environment**: pgAdmin / psql / DBeaver (any client is suitable)
- **Output format**: SQL files with embedded results or `.csv` exports

---

## 📌 Notes

- All outputs are saved as `.sql` or `.csv` files.
- Results from query executions are included inside each file where applicable.
- Screenshots are not used — output is saved in structured text and CSV format.

## 📤 How to Run

To run the queries:
1. Open your PostgreSQL client (e.g., pgAdmin).
2. Connect to your database containing the eCommerce schema.
3. Run any SQL file from the `outputs/` folder.
4. Optional: review the results in the corresponding `.csv` output files.
